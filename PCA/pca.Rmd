# Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of many methods commonly used to describe patterns in data. PCA is especially useful when analyzing gene expression data as it reduces the data’s dimensionality by projecting it onto “components”, and also summarizes the important features of the data (as the components maximize the variance of the data).

# Some R basics...

## Helpful R websites

1. <http://www.r-tutor.com>

2. <https://www.r-bloggers.com>

3. <http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/r/topics> This one is cool and new!! 

## R Studio

I would recommend downloading [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com). It's a better version of the R GUI. And when you become obsessed with VIM (you will, don't worry), you can set R Studio to VI mode and everything will be good in the world.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document (markdown == "simplified" latex...). 
I encourage you to write your "lab notes" for anything you do in R/python in this kind of document (BUT do as I say, not as I do!).
R Markdown is based on ``Markdown'' which is used on a lot of websites (ahem..Reddit), and is used for all those README.md files you see on github.
However...if you really like LaTeX, you can even call R in all TeX stuff using notation similar to R Markdown.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and <https://gist.github.com/jeromyanglim/2716336>.

[//]: P.S. this is how you comment your RMD!

# Important and helpful R commands/functions

As you might know, R is a statistical programming language, meaning, so it's gotta be good at math. R has a lot of great built in commands. For example, it can be used as a calculator:

```{r, cache=TRUE}

(sqrt(62527) + (67*3275)) / 8.2
```
Some examples of commands that I use every day:

```{r}
# setting your working directory

#setwd("~/some/file/path") 

# keep a seperate working directory for every project!

# creating a vector
x <- c(4,75,89,12, 9)
y <- c(1:5)
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
# random, normally distributed of length 10
z <- c(rnorm(5)) 
# bind by columns, create matrix
mat <- cbind(x,y,z)
# dimensions of matrix
dim(mat)

# get column 2
mat[,2]
# get row 3
mat[3,]
```





## Using data in R

R has a lot of built-in datasets.
You can access them like:

```{r}
data(cars)
head(cars)
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

*PS. easy keyboard shortcut to inserting code chunks is Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)*

The interwebs also have a lot of R datasets you can play around with....

```{r}
library(data.table)
mydat <- fread('http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/datasets/csb/ch11b.dat')
head(mydat)
```

Finally, you can also import your own data...
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("file/path/data.csv", row.names=1, 
header=FALSE)
# writing a csv is similar
write.csv(data, file="~/file/path/2/write/data.csv", sep=",")
```

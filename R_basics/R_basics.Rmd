# Some R basics...

## Helpful R websites

1. <http://www.r-tutor.com>

2. <https://www.r-bloggers.com>

3. <http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/r/topics> This one is cool and new!! 

## R Studio

I would recommend downloading [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com). It's a better version of the R GUI. And when you become obsessed with VIM (you will, don't worry), you can set R Studio to VI mode and all will be good in the world.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document (markdown == "simplified" latex...). 
I encourage you to write your "lab notes" for anything you do in R/python in this kind of document (BUT do as I say, not as I do!).
R Markdown is based on ``Markdown'' which is used on a lot of websites (ahem..Reddit), and is used for all those README.md files you see on github.
In R Markdown, you can "knit" output to PDF, HTML and Word documents.

However...if you really like LaTeX, you can call R in all TeX stuff using notation similar to R Markdown using Sweave (this can be really useful when making presentations in beamer).
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and <https://gist.github.com/jeromyanglim/2716336>.

[//]: P.S. this is how you comment your RMD!

# Important and helpful R commands/functions

As you might know, R is a statistical programming language, meaning, it's gotta be good at math. R has a lot of great built in commands. For example, it can be used as a calculator:

```{r, cache=TRUE}

(sqrt(62527) + (67*3275)) / 8.2
```
Some examples of commands that I use every day:

```{r}
# setting your working directory

#setwd("~/some/file/path") 

# keep a seperate working directory for every project!

# creating a vector
x <- c(4,75,89,12, 9)
y <- c(1:5)
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
# random, normally distributed of length 10
z <- c(rnorm(5)) 
# bind by columns, create matrix
mat <- cbind(x,y,z)
# dimensions of matrix
dim(mat)

# get column 2
mat[,2]
# get row 3
mat[3,]
```



## Using data in R

R has a lot of built-in datasets.
You can access them like:

```{r}
data(cars)
head(cars)
data(iris)
head(iris)
```

*PS. easy keyboard shortcut to inserting code chunks in R Markdown is Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)*

The interwebs also have a lot of R datasets you can play around with....

```{r}
library(data.table)
mydat <- fread('http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/datasets/csb/ch11b.dat')
head(mydat)
```

Finally, you can also import your own data...
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("file/path/data.csv", row.names=1, 
header=FALSE)
# writing a csv is similar
write.csv(data, file="~/file/path/2/write/data.csv", sep=",")
```

## Installing/loading packages

There are 2 main locations for R packages that you'll be using: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org).
Bioconductor has more "bioinformatic"-y packages. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Installing from CRAN
install.packages('ggplot2') #notice the quotes!
library(ggplot2) # notice NO quotes!


# Installing from Bioconductor
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite() # this installs/updates bioconductor
biocLite('WGCNA') # this will install packages, notice the quotes
library(WGCNA)
```

### But what if you don't know how to use the packages...

R Packages come with PDFs and help files. The good packages come with full-blown tutorials. One of the best things about these help files is that, as long as you've installed the package, they are stored locally and do not require internet access. To access these files you can:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
?ggplot
help(ggplot)
vignette("parallel")

## What if you need a function, but forget what package it's in?

??predict #"??"" searches R help files!
```
